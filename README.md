### **INTRODUCTION**
***
> This project graphically demonstrates the different variations of some basic sorting algorithms as applied on a dynamic data bar set.

### **REQUIREMENTS**
***
> This code base requires no specific modules outside of a basic web browser that supports the current **javascript ES6 modules**.

### **INSTALLATION**
***
> After cloning the main, repository into a local system directory, run the ***.\index.html*** file in a javascript-supported web browser.

### **CONFIGURATION**
***
> 1. The main graphical index of the application consists of three sections of user interaction.
>     - **Control Panel**
>     - **Graphical Canvas**
>     - **Bar Navigator**
>
> 2. Control Panel maintains the projects active buttons for the various sort algorithms, as well as a generic array button for automatically refreshing page activity. There is also an adjustable range slider that randomizes the data bar set and changes the sorting speeds.
> 3. Graphic Canvas, this is where the magic happens.
> 4. Bar navigator enables view of sorted bars and maximizes concurrency on the graphical canvas.
